# Plugins

This is a monolithic repo for Division Void plugins, based on the good work of EyalAmir
 
## Updates and future plans
PanelBase.h should be migrated to the module, and a number of features should be added, including helper functions for filling labels, a name as part of the constructor, etc. Naming the component will allow for greater flexibillity when it comes to understanding the components and designing modularity between repeated components.
